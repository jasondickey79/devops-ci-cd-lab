# DevOps CI/CD Jenkins Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates a full end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub.
The pipeline builds, tests, scans, and deploys a simple Python-based microaservice automatically.

This lab is designed to simulate real-world DevOps workflows using a lightweight but realistic application.
